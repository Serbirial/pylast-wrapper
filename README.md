# Pylast Wrapper
 Wrapper for pylast to make some things easier
 
 
# Main focus 
 Key based sessions\
 Simple pre-made database(s) to save session keys
 
 
# For now
 Everything is in one file, that will change.\
 Naming might not be right, classes are prone to name changes, function naming might be changed, etc.\
 Documentation is **zero**, please look at the examples (test_*). i will work on it when the project is in a publishable state, please be patient.
 (No garuntees on pylast documentation itself, i will try to make this project as simple to use as possible, even without knowing how to use pylast)
